<p>We have said that the result of an internal composition we can handle it as another table. Specifically, the result of an internal composition can be part of a larger internal composition with another table and so on.</p><p>I mean, we could have, in the clause. <code>FROM</code>a composition like the following:</p><p><code>FROM tabla1 JOIN tabla2 ON (tabla1.atributo1 = tabla2.atributo2) JOIN tabla3 ON (tabla2.atributo2 = tabla3.atributo3)</code></p><h3>Example:</h3><p>The following sentence shows the departments that are in the country whose name is 'United Kingdom'.</p><blockquote><p><code>SELECT DEPARTMENT_NAME, COUNTRY_NAME<br/>FROM departments JOIN locations USING (LOCATION_ID) JOIN countries USING (COUNTRY_ID)<br/>WHERE COUNTRY_NAME = 'United Kingdom';</code></p></blockquote><p>We must note that, in this case, we have used <code>USING</code> because the relationship we are doing between two attributes that have the same name, although we could also have used <code>ON</code>:</p><blockquote><p><code>ON (departments.LOCATION_ID = locations.LOCATION_ID)</code></p></blockquote><p></p><table align="center" border="1" summary="Results from query 18"><tbody><tr><th style="text-align: center; background-color: rgb(158, 158, 158);">DEPARTMENT_NAME</th><th style="text-align: center; background-color: rgb(158, 158, 158);">COUNTRY_NAME</th></tr><tr><td>Human Resources</td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Sales</td><td>United Kingdom</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Although in the <code>SELECT</code> We only use attributes of tables <code>departments</code> and <code>countries</code>In the <code>FROM</code> We need to also include the table <code>locations</code> because it is not possible to achieve <code>countries</code> from <code>departments</code>Without going through <code>locations</code>.
