<p>Often, working with values <code>NULL</code> It's uncomfortable. Function <code>COALESCE(value [, ...])</code> allows us to assign a value other than the attributes of a registry whose value <code>NULL</code>.</p><h3>Example:</h3><p>The siguinete consults shows employee 149 subordinates along with the department in which they are assigned. If any of those employees don't have an assigned department (it's <code>NULL</code>) must appear assigned to department 260 (<code>Recruiting</code>)</p><blockquote><p><code>SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, DEPARTMENT_ID, COALESCE(DEPARTMENT_ID, 260) AS "DEPARTMENT"<br/>FROM employees<br/>WHERE MANAGER_ID = 149;</code></p></blockquote><table align="center" border="1" summary="Results from query"><tbody><tr><th style="background-color:#9e9e9e; text-align:center">FIRST_NAME</th><th style="background-color:#9e9e9e; text-align:center">LAST_NAME</th><th style="background-color:#9e9e9e; text-align:center">DEPARTMENT_ID</th><th style="background-color:#9e9e9e; text-align:center">DEPARTMENT</th></tr><tr><td>Ellen.</td><td>Abel</td><td>80</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Alyssa</td><td>Hutton</td><td>80</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Jonathon</td><td>Taylor</td><td>80</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>Livingston</td><td>80</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Kimberely</td><td>Grant</td><td>-</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Charles</td><td>Johnson</td><td>80</td><td>80</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Exercise:</h3><p>It shows the name, surnames, work and the monthly salary to which the commissions have been applied and has been rounded to the cents.
