<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to order more than one attribute. In that case, we should separate the attributes we will use to order the results by comma:</p><blockquote><p><code>SELECT <em>atributos</em><br/>FROM <em>tabla</em><br/>ORDER BY <em>atributo </em>[DESC | ASC ], <em>atributo </em>[DESC | ASC ], ...;</code></p></blockquote><h3>Example:</h3><p>Let's show the directions (<code>locations</code>) ordered, descending by the country (<code>COUNTRY_ID</code>) and ascending through the city. Of all the attributes of the table locations we can show, let's choose <code>STREET_ADDRESS</code>, <code>COUNTRY_ID</code> and <code>CITY</code>:</p><blockquote><p><code>SELECT STREET_ADDRESS, COUNTRY_ID, CITY FROM<br/>LOCATIONS<br/>ORDER BY COUNTRY_ID DESC, CITY ASC;</code></p></blockquote><table align="center" border="1px solid" summary="Results from query"><tbody><tr><th>STREET_ADDRESS</th><th>COUNTRY_ID</th><th>CITY</th></tr><tr><td>2004 Charade Rd</td><td>US</td><td>Seattle</td></tr><tr><td>2007 Zagora St</td><td>US</td><td>South Brunswick</td></tr><tr><td>2011 Interiors Blvd</td><td>US</td><td>South San Francisco</td></tr><tr><td>2014 Jabberwocky Rd</td><td>US</td><td>Southlake</td></tr><tr><td>8204 Arthur St</td><td>UK</td><td>London</td></tr><tr><td>Magdalen Centre, The Oxford Science Park</td><td>UK</td><td>Oxford</td></tr><tr><td>9702 Chester Road</td><td>UK</td><td>Stretford</td></tr><tr><td>198 Clementi North</td><td>GS</td><td>Singapore</td></tr><tr><td>Pieter Breughelstraat 837</td><td>NL</td><td>Utrecht</td></tr><tr><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If we look at each other, we will see that the first criterion for which it is ordered is the country. In this way, all the addresses of the country whose code are first displayed (<code>COUNTRY_ID</code>) is "US", followed by all those who have the "UK" code, as ordination is descending.</p><p>But, <em><strong>Are the addresses of the same country ordered?</strong></em> The answer is <strong>YES</strong>. Among all the addresses in which the country code is <code>"US"</code>, appear in the first place those who alphabetically have a smaller city name, although this is better observed between the addresses that have the country code <code>"UK"</code>.</p><p>Exercise:</p><p>Show the name (<code>FIRST_NAME</code>), the last names (<code>LAST_NAME</code>), department number (<code>DEPARTMENT_ID</code>) and the salary (<code>SALARY</code>) of employees (<code>employees</code>) ordered upwardly by the number of the department and, within each department, from those of the highest salary to those of lower salary.</p><p></p>
