<p>We have seen how to reduce the number of columns (<em>attributes</em>) that are shown in a result, so that no data appears in a result that, for example, could violate data protection regulations. Then we will see how to reduce the number of rows (<em>records</em>) that will appear as a result of a consultation.</p><p>To select the records that will be part of the result of a query, we will have to define a number of conditions, so that the record that fulfills them will be part of the result and the records that do not comply with those conditions will not appear.</p><p>The conditions will be introduced in the consultation through the clause <code>WHERE</code>in the order shown below:</p><blockquote><p><code>SELECT [<em>atributos</em>]<br/>FROM [<em>tabla</em>]<br/>WHERE [condici√≥n]<br/>ORDER BY [<em>atributos</em>];</code></p></blockquote><p>The condition will be in the format <em>expression operator expression</em>in which an expression can be:</p><ul><li>a constant</li><li>an arithmetic expression</li><li>value</li><li>a name of a column.</li></ul><h3>Example:</h3><p>Let's show on what street (<code>STREET_ADDRESS</code>) is the branch whose address (<code>locations</code>) is in the city (<code>CITY</code>) of '<code>Roma</code>'. We continue to use the scheme <code>HR</code>.</p><p>All the information is in the statement and we have to learn to extract it and place it in the corresponding position of our sentencing skeleton:</p><blockquote><p><code>SELECT <strong>STREET_ADDRESS</strong><br/>FROM <strong>locations</strong><br/>WHERE <strong>CITY</strong> = '<strong>Roma</strong>';<br/><s>ORDER BY [<em>atributos</em>]</s></code> <small><em>in this case we are not specified any order, so we omit the clause ORDER BY.</em></small></p></blockquote><p>On this occasion, the condition was in the format <strong>name of attribute</strong> (<code>CITY</code>) <strong>operator </strong>(<code>=</code>) and <strong>constant text</strong> (<code>'Roma'</code>).</p><p><em><small>It is important to note that when we use a <strong>constant text</strong> in an expression, we lock it between <strong>simple quotes</strong> ('), otherwise, the database manager will believe that we are trying to refer to an attribute of a table and, most likely, is that it generates a mistake.</small></em></p><p>The result of the previous sentence is as follows:</p><table align="center" border="1" summary="Results from query"><tbody><tr><th>STREET_ADDRESS</th></tr><tr><td>1297 Via Cola di Rie</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Exercise:</h3><p>Of all the employees in the scheme <code>HR</code>, shows the name (<code>FIRST_NAME</code>), surnames (<code>LAST_NAME</code>) and salary (<code>SALARY</code>) of those whose work (<code>JOB_ID</code>) is the programmer (<code>'IT_PROG'</code>), ordered from the one that charges the least.</p><p><em><small><strong>Very important note: </strong>Note that the Database Manager differentiates between capitals and lowercases, so that it is not the same 'IT_PROG' as 'It_Prog' or 'it_prog', so, whenever possible, it is advisable to copy and paste the text strings.</small></em></p>
