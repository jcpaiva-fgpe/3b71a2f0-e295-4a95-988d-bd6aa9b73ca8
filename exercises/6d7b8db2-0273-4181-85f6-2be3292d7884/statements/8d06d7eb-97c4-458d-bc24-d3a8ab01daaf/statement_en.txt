<p>In a previous example we have seen a way of showing the directions that were in China (<strong>'CN'</strong>or in Japan (<strong><cite>'JP'</cite></strong>).</p><blockquote><p><code>SELECT STREET_ADDRESS, CITY<br/>FROM locations<br/>WHERE <strong>COUNTRY_ID = 'CN' OR COUNTRY_ID = 'JP'</strong>;</code></p></blockquote><p>Use <code>OR </code>to compose a logical expression in which the same attribute can have a series of values is valid if the list of values is very small, as in the previous case, in which we only have 2 options.</p><p>But what would happen if the list of possible values increased, for example to all in Europe. That list should include, at least: 'IT', 'UK', 'DE', 'CH', 'NL'. The sentence would then be much longer:</p><blockquote><p><code>SELECT STREET_ADDRESS, CITY, COUNTRY_ID<br/>FROM locations<br/>WHERE <strong>COUNTRY_ID = 'IT' OR COUNTRY_ID = 'UK' OR COUNTRY_ID = 'DE' OR COUNTRY_ID = 'CH' OR COUNTRY_ID = 'NL'</strong>;</code></p></blockquote><p>Instead, with the use of the set operator <code>IN </code>it reduces a lot and the previous sentence is clarified:</p><blockquote><p><code>SELECT STREET_ADDRESS, CITY, COUNTRY_ID<br/>FROM locations<br/>WHERE COUNTRY_ID <strong>IN ('IT', 'UK', 'DE', 'CH', 'NL')</strong>;</code></p></blockquote><h3>Exercise:</h3><p>Shows the employees of the scheme <code>HR</code> whose work is one of the following lists <code>'SA_MAN'</code>, <code>'SA_REP'</code>, <code>'MK_MAN'</code>,<code> 'MK_REP'</code>.</p><p>Order the results alphabetically by the last name.</p><p><small><em><strong>Remember:</strong></em> The result must be exactly as shown in the output of the Tests.</small></p><p></p>
