<p><code>SUM(expression)</code> Returns the result <strong>sumar</strong> all existing values <code>expresi√≥n</code>.</p><h3>Examples:</h3><p>How much does the company spend on the salaries of department employees whose identifier is 60?</p><blockquote><p><code>SELECT SUM(SALARY) AS "SALARIES COST"<br/>FROM employees<br/>WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 60;</code></p></blockquote><table align="center" border="1" summary="Results from query"><tbody><tr><th style="background-color:#9e9e9e; text-align:center">SALARIES COST</th></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">28800.00</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Sometimes the expression will be more complex.</p><p>In a previous example, we showed the monthly wage, rounded to the cents, of the employees whose work began by <code>AD</code>. Let's see now, how much we spend monthly on those employees:</p><blockquote><p><code>SELECT SUM(ROUND(SALARY / 12, 2)) AS "AD... SALARIES COST"<br/>FROM employees<br/>WHERE JOB_ID LIKE 'AD%';</code></p></blockquote><table align="center" border="1" summary="Results from query 9"><tbody><tr><th style="background-color:#9e9e9e; text-align:center">AD...
