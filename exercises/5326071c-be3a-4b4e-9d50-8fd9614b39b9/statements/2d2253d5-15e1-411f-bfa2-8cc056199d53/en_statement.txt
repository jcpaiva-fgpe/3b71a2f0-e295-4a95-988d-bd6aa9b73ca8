<h1>Subqueries in the <code>WHERE</code> clause that return tuples of values.</h1><p>Looking at the subqueries we have performed so far, we can see that, in the <code>SELECT</code>, we have only included an expression. Although it is not as normal as in the previous cases, there are times when it is convenient for us to compare pairs of values, instead of single values.</p><h3>Example:</h3><p>Who are the least senior Do you have each of the departments?:</p><blockquote><p><code>SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME<br />FROM employees<br />WHERE (DEPARTMENT_ID, HIRE_DATE) IN (<br /> SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, MIN(HIRE_DATE)<br /> FROM employees<br /> GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID<br />)<br />ORDER BY DEPARTMENT_ID;</code></p></blockquote><table align=" center" border="1" summary="Results from query"><tbody><tr><th style="background-color:#9e9e9e; text-align:center">DEPARTMENT_ID</th><th style=" background-color:#9e9e9e; text-align:center">FIRST_NAME</th><th style="background-color:#9e9e9e; text-align:center">LAST_NAME</th></tr><tr> <td>10</td><td>Jennifer</td><td>Whalen</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Michael</td><td> Hartstein</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>Den</td><td>Raphaely</td></tr><tr><td>...< /td><td >...</td><td>...</td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><h3>Exercise:</h3><p>< em>Who are the employees who earn the most for each type of job?</em>.</p><p>Order the results alphabetically by job and, if they coincide in the job, by last name.< /p>
